            <article>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with
                a new
                son
                and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                beyond the world of known physics.</article>
            <article>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of
                light for a prodigiously violent instant.</article>
            <article>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in
                the ocean.</article>
            <article>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around
                it.</article><br><br>

                <article>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                    wondered
                    whether it could ever be proved.</article>
                <article>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                    discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
                    realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</article>
                <article>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in
                    space
                    with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                    extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an
                    endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling

            <article>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
                beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
                Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</article>
            <article>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the

                gravitational waves.”</article>
            <article>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
                that
                permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as
                the
                surface of the sun.</article>

                Imaging of

                <p class="TContent"><b>THE UNIVERSE</b> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the
                    Milky Way galaxy, we
                    can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
                    Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled
                    the
                    vast distance
                    from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered
                    patches
                    of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>DISTANT COFFEE</b> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a
                    mile in
                    one direction.
                    You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how
                    much it
                    has cooled.</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</b> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction.
                    You
                    see a similar
                    coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in
                    every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="secondLine">
                <p class="TContent"><b>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups

                    place to place
                    before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot,
                    all
                    at the same time, that might explain their even temperature</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>INFLATION</b> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a
                    trillionth of a second
                    after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the
                    violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the
                    universe.
                </p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>FLUCTUATION</b> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient
                    fluctuations in swirls of
                    polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early
                    universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>EXPANSION</b> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding
                    faster than light
                    and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the
                    structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
