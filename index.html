            <article>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with
                a new
                son
                and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                beyond the world of known physics.</article>
            <article>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of
                light for a prodigiously violent instant.</article>
            <article>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in
                the ocean.</article>
            <article>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around
                it.</article><br><br>

                <article>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,

                    whether it could ever be proved.</article>
                <article>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent

                    realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</article>
                <article>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in
                    space
                    with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose

            <article>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
                beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
                Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</article>
            <article>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</article>
            <article>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in

            <article>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
                that
                permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as

                <p class="TContent"><b>THE UNIVERSE</b> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the
                    Milky Way galaxy, we
                    can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
                    Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled
                    the
                    vast distance
                    from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered
                    patches
                    of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>DISTANT COFFEE</b> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a
                    mile in
                    one direction.
                    You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how
                    much it
                    has cooled.</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</b> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction.
                    You
                    see a similar
                    coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in
                    every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>

            <div class="secondLine">
                <p class="TContent"><b>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups

                    place to place
                    before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot,
                    all
                    at the same time, that might explain their even temperature</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>INFLATION</b> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a
                    trillionth of a second
                    after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the
                    violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the
                    universe.
                </p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>FLUCTUATION</b> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient
                    fluctuations in swirls of
                    polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early
                    universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
                <p class="TContent"><b>EXPANSION</b> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding
                    faster than light
                    and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the
                    structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>

                space.</article>

                Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
                discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel
                Prize.
            </article>
            <article>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders
                of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,
                where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the
                University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

            <article>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He
                has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

            <article>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning
                the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</article>
            <article>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
                waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
                direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in
                the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</article>
            <article>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of
                the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

            <article>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</article>
            <article>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a
                Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them
                to the breakthrough.</article>
            <article><strong>A Special Time</strong></article>
            <article>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in
                his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.

            <article>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
                suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
                homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly,
                a concept known as the multiverse.</article>
            <article>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any
                deeper into the past.</article>
            <article>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
                everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
                forever out of our view.</article>
            <article>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not
                part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</article>
